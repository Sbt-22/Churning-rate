This is a data science project that determines whether a customer will churn or not.
I used a data from Kaggle website- A website fir data scientists all over the world.
I trained my model using that data and picked a few variables that had high correlation with "churn"- our Y variable.
I then used Flask to bind the back end and the fron end.
